Graphical Python application used for collecting information and generating reports for an online club.

- **Description:** A Python application featuring a Qt based GUI used to scrape and parse HTML data from a live website and produce concise reports about club members.
- **What I Learned:** In this project I learned more about applying CSS Stylesheets to a Qt GUI. I learned to read in and parse HTML using the 'urlllib', 'BeautifulSoup' and 'soupsieve' Python modules.
